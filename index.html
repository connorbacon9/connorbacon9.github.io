<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>I was born and raised in Spokane, WA where I have lived my whole life. I initially chose design as my major after doing some design work for bands before heading into college. I figured it would be a good way to continue studies since I already had some experience in the field. After taking a few classes it opened my eyes to a large amount of new concepts in design and grabbed my interest on a greater scale. </p>

<p>After graduation I would like to find myself in a design firm working towards web based design and graphics. Since I am more heavily involved in the graphic and visual aspect of design, this would be the ideal fit for me.</p>

<h2>Skill Set</h2>

<ul>
<li>Web Design</li>
<li>Illustration</li>
<li>Watercolor</li>
<li>Vector</li>
<li>Customer Relations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>After graduation, I attended Spokane Falls community college to get my associates degree, from which I moved onto EWU. I am currently a Junior with only a few classes left to become a senior. Outside of class I am constantly delving into the arts and design to help further my knowledge of my studies.</p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<p>I have worked in a variety of environments from warehouse stocking to general retail. A majority of my work has dealt with customer relations and interaction. On the side I have had many clients for logo work and design through local and national bands.</p>
