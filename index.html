<section>
<p>I was born and raised in Spokane, WA where I have lived my whole life. I initially chose design as my major after doing some design work for bands before heading into college. I figured it would be a good way to continue studies since I already had some experience in the field. After taking a few classes it opened my eyes to a large amount of new concepts in design and grabbed my interest on a greater scale.</p> 

<p>After graduation I would like to find myself in a design firm working towards web based design and graphics. Since I am more heavily involved in the graphic and visual aspect of design, this would be the ideal fit for me.</p>

<h3>Skill Set</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Web Design</li>
 <li> Illustration</li>
 <li> Watercolor</li>
 <li> Vector </li>
 <li> Customer Relations
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  
<h3>Education</h3>

<p>After graduation, I attended Spokane Falls community college to get my associates degree, from which I moved onto EWU. I am currently a Junior with only a few classes left to become a senior. Outside of class I am constantly delving into the arts and design to help further my knowledge of my studies.</p>

  <h3>Work</h3>

<p>I have worked in a variety of environments from warehouse stocking to general retail. A majority of my work has dealt with customer relations and interaction. On the side I have had many clients for logo work and design through local and national bands.</p>
